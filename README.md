### Project Description
On a hot sunny day, it suddenly started raining‚Äîa sign in Kerala that the fox and hen are getting married. That sparked the idea for our quirky React app: "Kurakkanum Kozhiyudeyum Kalyanam". In this fun little world, mischievous foxes and adorable hens create profiles, drop cheesy pickup lines, and wait for their match‚Äîbut only when it‚Äôs both sunny and rainy. Though they‚Äôre natural enemies, here they live like humans‚Äîposting pictures, flirting, and hoping to find love. Wild, weird, and delightfully useless.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Foxes and hens can‚Äôt fall in love‚Äîbecause nature said no. And apparently, they can only marry when it's sunny and rainy at the same time (Kerala folks know üëÄ). But what if they wanted to find love like the rest of us‚Äîflirting, posting selfies, and waiting for "the one"?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built a React app where naughty foxes and adorable hens can finally mingle! With random pickup lines, weather-based matchmaking, and chaotic profiles, it‚Äôs the most unnecessary love app ever made. Why? Because someone had to make it happen. üåßÔ∏è‚òÄÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
